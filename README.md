# is-it-lit

“is it lit?” is a web application providing a simple, easy to navigate platform for users to submit and read reviews of recent concerts performed by their favorite artists. 
The app was built using Node, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Specifically, Node packages used include Moment, a basic date-time formatting tool, Bandsintown, the API we used to gather data, Body Parser, Cookie Parser, and Node-Emoji.
